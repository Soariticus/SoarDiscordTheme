I had installed the BetterDiscord application to be able to add plugins, and themes, to my discord.

I founded the Frosted Glass theme, and ended up loving it. I customized it a lot, and had some interest from others in getting my config. After speaking with the original developer, he gave me permission to make a branch of it and list it publically on my Github.
